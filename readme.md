# ovsrpro

Build Overseer [dependencies](projects/README.md) by leveraging
[externpro](https://github.com/smanders/externpro).

## Installing ovsrpro

1. Download the installer for the release you need, for the your development
   environment (OS, compiler, etc). See
   <https://github.com/distributePro/ovsrpro/releases>.
1. Download the SHA256 checksum file for your release.
1. Validate the checksum.
   ```bash
   sha256sum --check ovsrpro-18.10.1-gcc631-64-Linux.sh.sha256
   ```
1. Run the installer.
   ```bash
   sudo ./ovsrpro-18.10.1-gcc631-64-Linux.sh --prefix=/opt/ovsrpro/ --include-subdir
   ```
   The recommended location for installation is */opt/ovsrpro/*. We also
   recommend using the subdirectory. Both these options are in this example.

## Using ovsrpro

Copy the file *share/cmake/Findovsrpro.cmake* from your installation to your
project's root directory. In your *CMakeLists.txt* add these lines:

```cmake
list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}")
find_package(ovsrpro 18.10.1 EXACT REQUIRED)
```

A few notes about the `find_package()` command:

1. The version is required in the command.
1. `EXACT` is required. If it's omitted, it is forced by *Findovsrpro.cmake*
   and a warning is issued.

If ovsrpro is found, the following variables are set:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
| Variable | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `ovsrpro_FOUND` | This is set to `true` if ovsrpro is found, and `false` if it not. |
| `ovsrpro_ROOT_DIR` | This is set to the root path where ovsrpro is installed. An example is */opt/ovsrpro/ovsrpro-20.04.1-gcc921-64-Linux/* |
| `ovsrpro_INCLUDE_DIR` | This is the root path to the project headers files. Each project will have a separate subdirectory within this path. An example is */opt/ovsrpro/ovsrpro-20.04.1-gcc921-64-Linux/include/*. Ovsrpro users typically should not need to use this. |
| `ovsrpro_LIBRARY_DIR` | This is the path to the project library files. An example is */opt/ovsrpro/ovsrpro-20.04.1-gcc921-64-Linux/lib/*. Ovsrpro users typically should not need to use this. |
| `ovsrpro_CONFIG_PATH` | This is the path to find the Qt5 CMake find scripts. This is needed to find Qt5 using `find_package()`. |
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

`${ovsrpro_ROOT_DIR}`*/share/cmake* is appended to `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`
automatically. To find ovsrpro projects, except for Qt5, add `find_package()`
commands.

```cmake
find_package(librdkafka)
find_package(zookeeper)
```

See each Find module's documentation for accepted components, define variables,
and imported targets.

To use Qt5, you must specify `HINTS` and `NO_DEFAULT_PATH` in `find_package()`.
This uses the CMake configuration scripts shipped with Qt5.

```cmake
find_package(
   Qt5
   HINTS "${ovsrpro_CONFIG_PATH}"
   NO_DEFAULT_PATH
   COMPONENTS Core
)
```

Here is a full example:

```cmake
find_package(ovsrpro 20.04.1 REQUIRED EXACT)
find_package(librdkafka COMPONENTS CPP)
find_package(zookeeper COMPONENTS CPP)
find_package(
   Qt5
   HINTS "${ovsrpro_CONFIG_PATH}"
   NO_DEFAULT_PATH
   COMPONENTS Core Gui
)
add_executable(AnApplication AnApplication.cpp)
target_link_libraries(
   AnApplication
   PRIVATE
      librdkafka::cpp
      Qt5::Core
      Qt5::Gui
      zookeeper::cpp
)
```

## Building ovsrpro

Developers should install an available package. If a package does not exist for
your system, use these instructions to build your own package.

### externpro

First, install [externpro](https://github.com/smanders/externpro). You must
install [version 18.8.4](https://github.com/smanders/externpro/releases/tag/18.08.4)
Use the same installation instructions as for ovsrpro, just substitute externpro
for ovsrpro.

### Building the Projects

1. Clone the repository.
1. In the repository, checkout the version you wish to build.
1. Create a build directory.
1. In the build directory, run CMake.
1. In the build directory, build the projects.
1. In the build directory, create an installation package.

```bash
cd ~/repositories/ovsrpro
git clone git://github.com/distributePro/ovsrpro.git
cd ovsrpro
git checkout 20.04.1
mkdir -p ~/repositories/ovsrpro/release
cd ../release
cmake -D XP_STEP=build ../ovsrpro
cmake --build .
cpack
```

Now, you can install your package, using the instructions above.

### CMake Options

For custom builds, the following CMake options are available:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
| Option | Default | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `XP_BUILD_DEBUG` | `on` | Build debug versions of the projects. Note that release versions are always built. |
| `XP_DEFAULT` | `on` | Compiles all of the available packages. To only compile a subset of the packages, set `XP_DEFAULT=off` and specify the individual packages desired. This is easier to do using cmake-gui or ccmake. |
| `XP_STEP` | `patch` | Specify which steps to complete of the build process. See the [externpro documentation](https://github.com/smanders/externpro/blob/master/README.md) for available options. |
